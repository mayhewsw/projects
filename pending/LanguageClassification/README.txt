This project would take as input some text in some natural language (French, Estonian, Spanish) that uses the Roman alphabet. (Could it also use Unicode?) The output would be classification of language. 

I would do this entirely by using n-grams. Data sets should not be too hard to find. I would need a corpus for each language. Perhaps nltk has enough data here?
