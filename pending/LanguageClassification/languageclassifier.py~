# Language classifier
# In short:
# Tokenize corpora by space, and create bigrams, trigrams, using letters.
# For example: "frogs eat fancy mangers" -> $f, fr, ro, og, gs, s_, _e, ea, ... etc.
# Testing would just be checking against various types of classifiers...
# Could also come up with backwards english classifier.
