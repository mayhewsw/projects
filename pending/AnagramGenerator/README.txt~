There is already an online program to do this. Can I do it faster? 

An important aspect of this is that it will split the input into several words if necessary. 

For example: "Eddie Mayhew" makes "may he die wed."

I believe the way this is accomplished is just to include a space in the input string. 

Then include two spaces, etc.
