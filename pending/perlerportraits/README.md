#Perler Portraits.

The goal of this project is to have an automated system for creating portraits from [Perler beads](http://www.amazon.com/Perler-Beads-000-Count-Bucket-Multi/dp/B0000AW5SU). The idea is that each bead acts as a pixel. Naturally, there is only a small number of colors available. This project maps images into the color space allowed by the perler beads. 

It is largely written in C++ using Opencv.

Below is an example of a photo mapped to the perler bead color space.
