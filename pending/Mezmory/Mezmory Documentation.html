<H2 CLASS="western">Installation</H2>
<P>You need to install python from their website...
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/download">www.python.org/download</A>.
</P>
<P>Once you have installed Python all you have to do is double-click
MezmoryBoard.py to run my program... more details on that are below.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">The basics</H2>
<P>Mezmory should be simple to use:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Use any program you like to save the text you want to
	memorize as a plain text file (*.txt)</P>
	<OL>
		<P>(Put the file in the same directory as MezmoryBoard.py)</P>
	</OL>
	<LI><P>Double-click MezmoryBoard.py to start up Mezmory.</P>
	<LI><P>A file dialog will appear. Type the name of your text file
	(complete with the *.txt) and your file will open.  
	</P>
	<OL>
		<P>Note: If Mezmory can't find your file it will open a small
		sample from James (&ldquo;James (NIV).txt&rdquo;) so you can see
		how it works. (You'll have to use the hint if you haven't memorized
		James.)</P>
	</OL>
	<LI><P>Try to type the passage that is in the file. 
	</P>
</OL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>If you type it correclty it will simply appear in black</P>
	<LI><P>If you skip a word (that is you type a word that is a little
	bit ahead), the words you skip will appear grey</P>
	<LI><P>If you type a word that is grey, as long as it isn't too far
	back, then the word will turn blue and you can keep typing from
	there. (You can also keep typing form where you were, and it will
	jump back ahead again.)</P>
	<LI><P>If you need a hint, press &ldquo;tab&rdquo;  - it will appear
	green</P>
	<LI><P>If you type a word that is wrong (or too far away), the word
	will simply dissappear. Thus what you see is always the correct
	text, without any mistakes in it.  (It may colored a little funny,
	but it is exactly what you saved in your plain text file).</P>
</UL>
<OL START=5>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you want to move forward or
	backwards a lot:</P>
</OL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tab = Forward one word (a hint)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Control-F = Forward a lot of words
	at once (say for example you want to go to chapter three... use
	this)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shift-Delete =  Backwards a lot of
	words at once (say for example you want to back up and try the last
	paragraph you just did because you made a lot of mistakes... a good
	way to learn)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Control-Delete = Backwards only
	one word at a time. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Note: Currently selecting and deleting
	text doesn't really do anything. The moment you start typing it will
	just go back wherever you were before.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Also Note: if you click back in the
	text somewhere the cursor will move, but it won't actually let you
	start typing there. It doesn't even know you clicked there and will
	continue as if you are still wherever you were typing last. Sorry.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Some tips on how to use the program for
memorization</H2>
<P>First of all, as I have alreay said, focus on the meanign of the
text. This is not all about your ability to remember the text word
for word. Yes, the program will help you to do that, but that isn't
what its about. It is about internalizing the text.</P>
<P>I typically don't use Mezmory until I have already mostly
memorized a text.  So far I've only been using it on texts that I
(partially) memorized a long time ago and have forgotten bits and
pieces of.  
</P>
<P>What I've done (and it has worked for me), is I say a phrase at a
time out loud, and then write it. It is amazing how much more
accurate it is when I've said the phrase aloud than if I just look
and type. Of course it also helps me to think about what it means!</P>
<P>If  I can't spell a word, or for any other reason a word won't
appear, I just type the next word and keep on going.  
</P>
<P>If I miss a whole phrase, I'll usually type it (remember, you
don't have to delete to type recently missed words, just type the
first word (or two) and you'll immediately go back to the beginning
of the phrase.</P>
<P>If all else fails I use the &ldquo;hint&rdquo;. Its not bad to use
the hint. 
</P>
<P>At the end of a paragraph if it looks really colorful (a lot of
grey and green, and maybe even if there is a lot of blue), then I
read the whole paragraph aloud, noting especially the words that I
missed.  I ponder the difference between what I said and what is
actually there so that I will remember the words next time. Sometimes
I just say the bits that I missed five or six times aloud until it
flows off my tongue (of course, as always thinking about what it
means!).</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Example of a subtle difference in meaning:</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Here's a subtle difference in
meaning...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The actual text:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eph 3:18 &ldquo;...may have power,
together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and
deep is the love of Christ, <SUP>19</SUP>and to know this love that
surpasses knowledge - that you may be filled to the measure of all
the fullness of God.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What I tried to write:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;...may have power, together with
all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the
love of Christ, <SUP>19</SUP>and <B>that you may </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">know
this love...</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Of
course, the program never lets wrong words appear, so &ldquo;that you
may&rdquo; dissappeared as I wrote them and the word &ldquo;to&rdquo;
was skipped (appearing gray).  When I thougth about the difference I
realized that Paul was not just praying that they may know the love,
but that they would have the power to know the love.  Christ's love
is so huge that it is by no means easy to know!</SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Some details about skipping forward and backward
by typing</H2>
<P>Usually if you want to jump back to a word you just type it.  You
can even skip a whole phrase if you forget it and jump forward by
typing whatever comes after the phrase. However, in order to keep
Mezmory from jumping all over like crazy, it won't jump more than 20
words at a time. (This is a single variable in the code that can be
changed if you are so inclined).</P>
<P>Not only that, Mezmory looks at the whole passage and sees which
words are the most common like &ldquo;the&rdquo; and &ldquo;and&rdquo;.
 For these common words you have to be really close to jump to them. 
So, if you've skipped the phrase &ldquo;and find out what pleases the
Lord&rdquo;, you may not be able to jump back to the &ldquo;and&rdquo;
by typing it, but if you type &ldquo;find&rdquo; it will jump back to
the beginning of the phrase.  It works the same way skipping
forwards. If you forget a word or two, it won't jump as far for words
like &ldquo;and&rdquo; and &ldquo;the&rdquo;. 
</P>
<P>Note: If you have a very short passage it may not be possible to
skip words unless you go and change some numbers in the code.</P>

<P>I'll note that I've been using TortoiseSVN to keep track of when
I've made what changes to the documents.  We could probably manage a
simple combination of e-mail and local Tortoise SVN if we both want
to keep tweaking the code. (TortoiseSVN is great for developing,
especially when shared by multiple people! Easy to use too. Perhaps
Josiah will help me to set up an SVN server if he thinks it is worth
it.)<BR><BR><BR>
