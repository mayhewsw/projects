This is a solver for Gabriele Cirulli's annoyingly addictive 2048 game.

I wanted to see which strategies worked out in the long run without having to do them myself.

Feel free to fork me and create your own strategy class! See if you can beat my best score! (which I will publish soon).



To run:

```
>> python solver.py
```


This uses splinter (http://splinter.cobrateam.info/) and PyUserInput (https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput). I'm running this on Ubuntu 14.04, 32-bit.
