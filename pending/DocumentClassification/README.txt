My main point in doing this is to try and classify course evaluations. It is not important or useful, but I wonder if it would be possible to figure it out. 

Consider this scenario: an English class, and the professor has collected several essays already. Thus, for each student, there is a corpus in their writing style. 

Come course evaluation time, the professor wants to know who wrote the scathing eval. This system could find that out.

It may be that a Naive Bayes algorithm would do the trick here.
