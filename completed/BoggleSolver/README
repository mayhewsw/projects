BoggleSolver - README
----------------------

This program will find all the word solutions for Boggle. 

Invoke it like this:

  >> python BoggleSolver.py <inputstring>

Note that <inputstring> represents the board. If a 4x4
board looks like this:

     s h o r
     g i s t
     h t e d
     s s e n

then <inputstring> is: 'shorgisthtedssen'

There are a few restrictions on the input string:
      - It must contain lowercase letters only (no numbers, punctuation, etc.)
      - Its length must be a square number (e.g. 9, 25, 36, ...)

Naturally, the longer the string, the slower the computation.
           
The dictionary is included in the folder: words.txt. It is taken from /usr/share/dict/words,
but has some words removed, namely words with apostrophes and words with accents. 

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_(Unix).

What's left to do
-----------------

Set it up so that it can accept an image, recognize the characters, and solve the
game. Shouldn't be too hard...
